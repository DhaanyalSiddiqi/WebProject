        <h2>Introduction</h2>
        <p>I initially wanted to desgin this website with a very minimalistic desgin in mind, wanting to keep things as simple and clean as possible. As I coded, however, I added a few features to liven up the website. I feel I still succeeded, however, in creating a clean but fun website while still retaining the professional look I wanted.</p>
        <br>

        <h2>Site Map</h2>
        <img class="sitemapimg" src="sitemap.jpg" alt="Site Map">
        <p class="top_border">The picture above shows my site map, a structure for how each page relates to the home page. The extensions on the left show things from the header, and the right items are from the footer. It should be noted that each page can be accessed irrelevant of which page you are on, however displaying this is the site map would have make the map very unclean and unreadable.</p>

        <h2>Breakpoints / Tweaking</h2>
        <p>Breakpoints are used multiple times throughout the website. They are mostly used to restructre the positioning of images with regards to the images they are near; this is because, if I dont, the images will span the full page width, and seeing that on a laptop resolution may be displeasing, whereas on a smaller screen such as mobile, the larger picture may be appreachated. Breakpoints have also been used for the menu and footer menu; I will elaborate on this in the next section.</p>
        <p>Some aspects of the website have been tweaked and modified from the origional desgin, purely for simplicity and readability.</p>

        <br>

        <h2>Menu System Design</h2>
        <p>The menu system has been designed with different structures with regards to different resolutions: mobile and laptop. The menu system for the laptop was given its own unique code in the media queries; it is set as a row; the items also have a hover feature: when you hover, a black background is displayed behind the items, and for the footer menu, an underline function is used; an extra level of enjoyability when using the website.</p>
        <p>When it comes to the mobile side of things, there are no special visual features. Initially I had planned to implement animations for this too, however I realised, on a mobile you only click, not hover. This means the animation would mostly be covered by the users finger, and thus, not very useful when coming back to the fact that its only reason to be in the code is to increase the immersiveness of the website. However, the structure of the menu and footer menu still change. They change from the media query set row, to the default column, as set in the code. In addition, margins between the buttons are also added for an extra layer of readability and ease of use.</p>

        <br>

        <h2>Mobie-First Responsive Web Desgin usage</h2>
        <p>Throughout the panning phase and the raw programming of this website, Mobile-First Responsive Web Design was used through the ways I coded; everything is built on a mobile friendly basis, and after completing it I then used media queries to restructure according to the different resolutions a user may view the website on.</p>
